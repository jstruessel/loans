This project consists of taking a data set consisting of many finacial statistics as well as one sentance used to request a loan from a bank, and running these through a nerual network to find a confidence interval of gaining an aprroval or denial of a loan. 

Strings cannot be run through the neural network model i used, so i also had to transform the sentances to arrays of numbers allowing us to find patterns within the data.
